- Unique visitor identification using hashed IP fingerprints (no cookies)
- Session tracking and session duration calculation
- Referrer source tracking
- User authentication — registration and login with JWT tokens
- Protected API routes via JWT middleware
- Dashboard metrics per website (page views, unique visitors, sessions, referrers)
- Website selector dropdown for switching between tracked sites
- Delete website functionality with confirmation dialogs
- Navigation menus (Back, Dashboard, Docs, Settings)
- Self-hosted support with SQLite database via Prisma ORM
- Docker deployment configuration (`infrastructure/Dockerfile`)

- Tracking code storage alongside website IDs

### Security
- Updated Vite to 7.3.1 (HIGH vulnerability fixed)
- Updated React Router to 7.13.0 (HIGH vulnerability fixed)

- Created `infrastructure/` for deployment configs
- Created `scripts/` for utility scripts
- Created `env/` for environment variables (gitignored)
