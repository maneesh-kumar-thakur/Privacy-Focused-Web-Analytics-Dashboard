## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Privacy-Focused-Web-Analytics-Dashboard.git
cd Privacy-Focused-Web-Analytics-Dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database

pnpm db:push
```

### 4. Start Development Servers

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:8080

### 5. Run Quality Checks

Before opening a PR, make sure all checks pass:

```bash

pnpm typecheck       # TypeScript
pnpm test            # Tests
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** — keep them focused and minimal. One concern per PR.

3. **Test your changes** — run `pnpm quality-check` and verify the app works locally.

4. **Commit** using the [commit message format](#commit-message-format) below.

5. **Push** and open a Pull Request against `main`.

6. **Fill in the PR template** — describe what changed and why.

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code passes `pnpm quality-check`
- [ ] New features have tests
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] PR targets the `main` branch
- [ ] Commit messages follow the format below

---

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript** — All new code must be fully typed. No `any` unless justified.
- **Formatting** — Use Prettier. Run `pnpm format.fix` before committing.
- **Linting** — Follow ESLint rules. Run `pnpm lint` to check.
- **Privacy first** — Never add features that collect PII, set cookies, or enable cross-site tracking.
- **Small PRs** — Easier to review and merge. Split large changes into multiple PRs.

## Suggesting Features

Before building something big, [open a discussion](https://github.com/maneesh-kumar-thakur/Privacy-Focused-Web-Analytics-Dashboard/discussions/categories/ideas) first. This avoids wasted effort and lets us align on direction.

For small improvements, a PR with a clear description is fine directly.
